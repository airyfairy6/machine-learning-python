REGRESSION RESULTS (SUMMARY)

Simple Linear Regression:
- Strong positive linear relationship observed.
- RMSE: ~5.2
- R² score: ~0.68

Multiple Linear Regression:
- RMSE improved vs simple regression.
- R² score: ~0.74
- Multicollinearity observed, resolved by regularization.

Regularization (Lasso/Ridge):
- Ridge reduced variance and stabilized coefficients.
- Lasso set several coefficients to zero (feature selection).

Regression Tree (Taxi Tip Prediction):
- Captured nonlinear relationships.
- Feature importance: Total Fare, Passenger Count, Trip Distance.
