CLUSTERING VISUALIZATION SUMMARY

K-Means Clustering (Customer Segmentation):
- Chosen number of clusters: k=4
- Clear separation between spending patterns and income levels.
- Silhouette score: 0.51

DBSCAN:
- Detected arbitrary-shaped clusters.
- Noise points identified successfully.
- Good for datasets with varying density.

HDBSCAN:
- More stable cluster assignments than DBSCAN.
- Automatically determined optimal number of clusters.

Interpretation:
K-Means = best for well-separated spherical clusters.
DBSCAN/HDBSCAN = best for real-world noisy data with dense regions.
