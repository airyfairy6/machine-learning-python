DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION RESULTS

PCA:
- PC1 explained 42% of the variance.
- PC2 explained 18% of the variance.
- Useful for understanding the strongest drivers in the data.

t-SNE:
- Revealed well-separated clusters not visible in PCA.
- Sensitive to perplexity parameter.

UMAP:
- Best global + local structure preservation.
- Clear cluster separation with minimal noise.

Interpretation:
PCA = good for linear compression.
t-SNE = good for visualization of small, separated clusters.
UMAP = best overall technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.
