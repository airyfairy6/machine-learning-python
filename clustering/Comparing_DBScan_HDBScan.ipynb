    "Congratulations! You're ready to move on to your next lesson! In this lab, you learned how to implement DBSCAN and HDBSCAN clustering models using scikit-learn on real data from StatCan, focusing on museum locations across Canada. You also compared the performance of the two clustering techniques.\n",
